## Advanced Lane Finder

### Description
Advanced Lane Finder is a Python program to detect lanes and highlight the lane area. ALF uses various computer vision techniques from OpenCV to process each frame in a video to detect the lanes. ALF was inspired and in many ways is based on the Advanced Lane Detection project from Udacity's Self Driving Car ND Program. 

### Documentation
#### Project Directory
**build:** A PyCharm project directory. The heart of this program lies in laneDetection.py, supporting functions are present in preprocess.py and calibrateCamera.py. <br/>
**data:** Sample data for you to experiment along with chessboard calibration images, make sure to replace them with new ones if you are going to use a new footage from your car to detect lanes. 

### Requirements
Python 3.6.x
